johnmark
========

A native markdown parser for Rust with zero dependencies.

Design
------

    // TODO


Advantages
----------

Currently, `johnmark` is still under development and still missing several
standard markdown features. That said, `johnmark` is planned to have the
following advantages.

### 100% native Rust. ###

Considering that even Rust's documentation is written in Rust, having a markdown
implementation in Rust is only logical.

### Zero dependencies ###

Just drop and go.
